# Virtual Fan üå¨Ô∏è

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by to check out my little project ‚Äî the **Virtual Fan**. It‚Äôs a simple, fun web app that lets you turn on/off a fan and control its speed. Kinda like having a mini fan right on your screen, but without the breeze (sorry!).

Oh and btw ‚Äî if you just wanna try it out real quick, here‚Äôs the live demo: [https://opcodexe-dev.github.io/virtual-fan](https://opcodexe-dev.github.io/virtual-fan)  
(no need to download anything, just click and play)

## What is this thing?

So, I made this for a quick practice with some HTML/CSS/JS ‚Äî trying to make something interactive that feels smooth and kinda cool. You get a fan blade image that spins when you hit ON, and you can set different speeds (1, 2, 3) or turn it off and watch it slow down nicely. Nothing too fancy, but it‚Äôs surprisingly satisfying to watch it spin!

## How to use it?

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge ‚Äî you name it).
3. Click the **ON** button to start the fan.
4. Choose speed buttons (1, 2, or 3) to crank it up or down.
5. Hit **OFF** to gently slow it down until it stops.

Super simple, right?

## How to install/run?

No crazy setup here. Just open the files locally or host them on any static server. If you wanna get fancy, toss it on GitHub Pages or Netlify and you‚Äôre good to go.

## The story behind it

Honestly? I just wanted to mess around with animations and `requestAnimationFrame`. Spinning something felt like a classic beginner fun project, but I tried to add a smooth slowdown when turning off ‚Äî felt a bit more real that way. Made me feel like I actually had a tiny desk fan. Also, picking the fan blade image and styling it took way more time than I thought lol.

If you wanna suggest improvements or just say hi, hit me up! Always happy to chat about silly little projects like this.

Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoy the Virtual Fan as much as I enjoyed making it!
